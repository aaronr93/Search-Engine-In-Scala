This program implements a relatively simple search engine by crawling all the links on a page. It assigns weights based on certain keywords.

To build and run:
1. Install Scala http://www.scala-lang.org/
2. Install SBT (Scala Build Tools) http://www.scala-sbt.org/
3. Ensure sbt is added to the system's PATH environment variable
4. In the project directory, open a command prompt and enter the following command:
	sbt run
	
NOTE: It will take 3-5 minutes to finish crawling.
